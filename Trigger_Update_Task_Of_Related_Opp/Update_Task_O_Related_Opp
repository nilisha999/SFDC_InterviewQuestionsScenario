 • If Stage = “Closed Lost” ➡️ Update related Tasks’ Status to “In Progress.”

🛠️ Key Challenges:
1️⃣ Handle bulk updates efficiently (e.g., updating multiple Opportunities simultaneously).
2️⃣ Ensure the solution avoids recursion and governor limit issues.
3️⃣ Make it scalable for a growing number of records.

💬 How would you approach this?
